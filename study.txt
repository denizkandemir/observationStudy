                             Observing Responsibility-Related Behaviors in a University Setting


    The purpose of this observation study was to examine everyday behaviors related to the personality trait 
of Conscientiousness within the OCEAN framework. Conscientiousness has aspects such as; punctuality, organization, 
reliability, and responsibility. In this study we used a naturalistic observation method and observed punctuality 
and responsibility in 6 different classes over two days. 

 
  Participiants

  The observed participiants of this study are university students in their usual classes.
  Approximately 30 - 45 individuals were observed depending the time of the classes.

  Setting

  The observation took place in university classes and observers sat down at the back of the class 
  in order to who is late and also who is not giving focus to the lesson(texting, playing games on computer).
  The observers did not interact with any individuals and noted behaviours discreetly to avoid influcing actions.

  Operational Definitions

   In this study, the following observable behaviors were defined:

   For observing punctuality; we noted how many students were ready 5 minute before the class.
   Also we noted how many students were late 5 minutes and 10 minutes after class start time.

   For observing responsibility; we noted how many students were focused to the lesson 5 and 45 minutes after the
   starting time. Also we noted how many students were not interested about the lesson in those time frames.

   Results

   Across all sessions

  Punctuality:
    72 students arrive on time.

    In the first 5 minutes of the lesson:
      13 students were not focused to the lesson.
